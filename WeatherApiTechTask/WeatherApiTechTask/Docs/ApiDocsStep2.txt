Step 2 | API design (no code required)

    Now that we have a service that reads the forecast for a city, we want to save this info in the Musement's API. 
    The endpoint that receives information about weather for a city does not exist, we only have these 2 endpoints for cities

    GET /api/v3/cities
    GET /api/v3/cities/{id}

    Please provide the design for:

        endpoint/s to set the forecast for a specific city
        endpoint/s to read the forecast for a specific city

    Please consider that we need to answer questions like :

        What's the weather in [city] today ?
        What will it be the weather in [city] tomorrow ?
        What was the weather in [city] on [day] ?

    For each endpoint provide all required information: endpoint, payload, possible responses etc and description about the behavior.

APIs to store and read weather data about cities

    1a. Create weather type info

        Endpoint: POST /api/v3/forecast

        Request payload:
        {
            "forecastType": {
                "description" : string
            }
        }

        Possible responses:
            -200 OK             if forecast description was already registered, with response payload { "forecastId" : int, "isNew" : false }
            -201 Created        if forecast description is new, with response payload { "forecastId" : int, "isNew" : true }
            -400 Bad request    if validation fails
            -500 Internal server error 
            -503 Service unavailable

        Behavior:
            -Check if the request is valid, else return 400
            -If the forecast description is already persisted, return his ID, else create a new one and persist it,
                on error return 500
            -Return result as described above


    1b. Set forecast of a specific city

        Endpoint: POST /api/v3/cities/{id}/weather

        Request payload: 
        {
            "forecast" : { 
                "days" : [
                    {
                        "date" : date(format:01-01-0001),
                        "forecastId" : int,
                    }, 
                    ...
                ]
            }
        }

        Possible responses:
            -200 OK             response payload 
            { "days" : [ 
                {"date" : date(format:01-01-0001), "forecast" : {"id":int, "description":string}, 
                "timestamp" : datetime, "overwrite" : boolean} 
            ] } 
            -400 Bad request    if validation fails
            -500 Internal server error 
            -503 Service unavailable

        Behavior: 
            -Check if the request is valid, else return 400
            -Check if the written IDs (city and forecasts) refers to persisted data and there are no repeated dates, 
                else return 400
            -Check further custom validations (for instance, dates too late not allowed), if them fails, return 400
            -Persist all new daily forecasts in a transaction, on any error rollback and return 500
            -Return result as described above

        Descriptions and considerations:
            -Old records could be unuseful, I've just inserted a boolean to indicate wheter an old weather record
                for that city on that day has been overwritten
    


    2. Get forecast of a specific city (only one day, selectable by date)

        Endpoint: GET /api/v3/cities/{id}/weather?date={date(format:01-01-0001)}

        Response payload: 
        {
            "hasWeatherInfo" : boolean,
            "timestamp": datetime, 
            "forecast" : { //nullable
                "id": int,
                "description" : string
            }
        }

        Possible responses:
            -200 OK             
            -400 Bad request    if validation fails
            -500 Internal server error 
            -503 Service unavailable

        Behavior: 
            -Check if the written ID actually refers to a city on system
            -Notice if
